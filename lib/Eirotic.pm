=head1 YET EXPERIMENTING

=head2 Unicode everywhere

is utf8::all a good idea ? use C<use> instead of my own import? 

=head2 List::AllUtils ? 

temptation is strong but i don't want to conflict with perlude, even in the
user's brain.

what about the idea from L<https://metacpan.org/author/BOOK> (used in Perlude): use a very short NS. like
C<A> for C<Array> and C<S> for stream? 

=head2 About autodie and fatal warnings

seems to be nice but maybe i should read L<http://blogs.perl.org/users/peter_rabbitson/2014/01/fatal-warnings-are-a-ticking-time-bomb-via-chromatic.html>
